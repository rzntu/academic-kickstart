This course is delivered using Python. 

#### Key takeaways: 
* Understand the challenges of textual data collection and analysis;
* Describe basic concepts and methods used in text mining (E.g., vector representation of documents, feature extraction, text classification and clustering etc.);
* Understand conceptually the mechanism of advanced text mining algorithms for tasks like text classification, clustering, opinion mining, and their applications in the real-world;
* Select appropriate machine learning tools/ techniques to uncover patterns and relationships, extract useful knowledge and support decision making in business applications;
* Craft a real-world problem and assemble required tools to yield meaningful solutions and conclusions.
