[This course](https://yiduai.sg/training-program-advance-level/) is an `intermediate level` 5-week intensive training program. In these 5 week, you will be fully exposed to deep learning and data science both online, offline and with your supportive community, and build up your project portfolio to achieve your career dreams. 

* **1.5 hours teaching + 1.5 hours hands-on in-class project per week**
* **In-class Kaggle Competition**

The `lesson table` is given as:

#### Week 1
* Basic concepts behind NLP and Deep Learning 
* Representation learning and TF-IDF Models
* Stochastic gadients descent
* Softmax and cross entropy error

###### In-class Project
Implement a basic Softmax layer from scratch (project)

##### Week 2
* Non-linearities behind neural networks
* Feed-forward computation for NN
* Back-propagation for NN
* Overfitting, Activation functions, Regularization

###### In-class Project
Tutorial on TensorFlow

#### Week 3
* Count-based Word representation 
* Neural network-based word2vec
* Inherent connections between Word2vec and TF-IDF models
* Recurrent Neural Networks and Language Model

###### In-class Project
Word vectors training model

#### Week 4
* Language Model
* Gradient Vanishing and Exploding
* Bi-directional Extension
* Cell Extension: LSTM or GRU

###### In-class Project
LSTM sentiment analysis

#### Week 5
* A brief review on CNN
* Implement multi-channel CNNs for sentiment analysis
* Design the code structure following a standard tensorflow template which can provide a good practice for our daily job.
