abstract: "In recent years, deep compositional models have emerged as a popular technique for representation learning of sentence in computational linguistic and natural language processing. These models normally train various forms of neural
networks on top of pre-trained word embeddings using a taskspecific
corpus. However, most of these works neglect the multisense
nature of words in the pre-trained word embeddings.
In this paper we introduce topic models to enrich the word
embeddings for multi-senses of words. The integration of the
topic model with various semantic compositional processes leads
to Topic-Aware Convolutional Neural Network (TopCNN) and
Topic-Aware Long Short Term Memory Networks (TopLSTMs).
Different from previous multi-sense word embeddings models
that assign multiple independent and sense-specific embeddings
to each word, our proposed models are lightweight and flexible
frameworks that regard word sense as the composition of two
parts: a general sense derived from a large corpus and a topicspecific
sense derived from a task-specific corpus. In addition, our
proposed models focus on semantic composition instead of word
understanding. With the help of topic models, we can integrate
the topic-specific sense at word-level before composition and
sentence-level after composition. Comprehensive experiments on
five public sentence classification datasets are conducted, and the
results show that our proposed Topic-Aware deep compositional
models produce competitive or better performance than other
text representation learning methods."
