abstract: "Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are of
significance to improve the safety and reliability of motors, given
their widespread applications in virtually every branch of the
industry. Sequential data modeling based on recurrent neural
network (RNN) and its variants have drawn increasing attention
because the temporal nature of motor signals can be well
leveraged for motor analysis. One common drawback of prior
research is that signals measured on motors are typically analyzed
with a fixed time window, making it difficult to trade off between
global state estimation and local feature extraction. This paper
presents a deep learning-based model termed Multi-Resolution &
multi-Sensor Fusion Network (MRSFN) for motor fault diagnosis,
through multi-scale analysis of motor vibration and stator current
signals. Specifically, vibration and current signals are first
segmented by analysis windows of varying lengths to create a new
data stream for the joint representation and temporal encoding of
the original sensor signals, based on two network structures:
convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term
memory (LSTM). The advantage of the developed method is that
it automatically learns the discriminative features through the
network training process, without requiring manual feature
selection as is typically the case in prior methods. By considering
the temporal dependence of the signals being analyzed, the
developed multi-resolution fusion technique not only improves the
effectiveness of feature extraction but is also adaptive to varying
motor speed. Two case studies demonstrate the advantages of the
developed method."
