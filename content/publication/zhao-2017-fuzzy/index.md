abstract: "One key issue in text mining and natural language
processing (NLP) is how to effectively represent documents using
numerical vectors. One classical model is the Bag-of-Words
(BoW). In a BoW-based vector representation of a document,
each element denotes the normalized number of occurrence of a
basis term in the document. To count the number of occurrence
of a basis term, BoW conducts exact word matching, which can
be regarded as a hard mapping from words to the basis term.
BoW representation suffers from its intrinsic extreme sparsity,
high dimensionality, and inability to capture high-level semantic
meanings behind text data. To address the above issues, we
propose a new document representation method named Fuzzy
Bag-of-Words (FBoW) in this paper. FBoW adopts a fuzzy
mapping based on semantic correlation among words quantified
by cosine similarity measures between word embeddings. Since
word semantic matching instead of exact word string matching is
used, the FBoW could encode more semantics into the numerical
representation. In addition, we propose to use word clusters
instead of individual words as basis terms and develop Fuzzy
Bag-of-WordClusters (FBoWC) models. Three variants under the
framework of FBoWC are proposed based on three different
similarity measures between word clusters and words, which are
named as FBoWCmean, FBoWCmax and FBoWCmin, respectively.
Document representations learned by the proposed FBoW and
FBoWC are dense and able to encode high-level semantics.
The task of document categorization is used to evaluate the
performance of learned representation by the proposed FBoW
and FBoWC methods. The results on seven real word document
classification datasets in comparison with six document representation
learning methods have shown that our methods FBoW
and FBoWC achieve the highest classification accuracies."
