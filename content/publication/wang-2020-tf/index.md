abstract: "The variability of machinery fault signatures causes the data  samples  to  follow  different  distributions  under  various operating  conditions,  which  poses  significant  challenges  on autonomous diagnosis based on machine learning techniques. This paper presents a new  transfer learning method for cross-domain feature learning  by  mitigating  the  domain  difference  caused  by various operating conditions for machinery autonomous diagnosis. More specifically, a factor analysis based transfer learning method is formulated and named as probabilistic transfer factor analysis. It  seeks  a  new  feature  space  across  different  domains corresponding to various operating conditions, and then transfers the  original  features  into  a  low-dimensional  latent  space  via feature  extraction to  minimize  domain  difference and  preservedata  properties.  The  learned  features  by  probabilistic  transfer factor analysis minimize the domain difference, and are then used to construct the machinery autonomous diagnosis model based on machine learning techniques (e.g.  support  vector  machine).  The effectiveness of the probabilistic transfer factor analysis method is demonstrated in  the  experimental  tests  for  a  gearbox  diagnosis cross  various  operating  conditions  comparing  with  traditional feature extraction and transfer learning techniques."
