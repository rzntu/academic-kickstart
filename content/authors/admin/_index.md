I am a Quantitative Researcher in Singapore. I completed my Ph.D studies at Nanyang Technological University supervised by Prof. Mao Kezhi. My Ph.D Dissertation title is Representation Learning for Sentences and Documents. Before that I obtained my undergraduate degree from Southeast University. In SEU, my FYP thesis Stochastic Resonance for Machine Fault Diagnosis is guided by Prof. Yan Ruqiang. I have several years experience in developing machine learning projects (from POC to production) across various domains. My main research intersts are machine learning, natural language processing and predicitive modelling. Currently, I am exploring the application of machine learning on prediction in trading.
